This project demonstrates the implementation of the linear regression algorithm entirely from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide a clear, step-by-step guide to understanding and coding linear regression without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn. By manually constructing the model, this project offers insights into the mathematical foundations of linear regression and the process of optimizing model parameters using gradient descent.

Project Features
Synthetic Data Generation: The project begins by generating synthetic data that mimics a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (y). This data is used to train and test the model.

Manual Model Construction: The core linear regression model is implemented from scratch, including:

Prediction function to compute outcomes using the linear equation 
𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑐
y=mx+c.
Cost function (Mean Squared Error) to measure the model's prediction error.
Gradient descent algorithm to iteratively optimize the slope (m) and intercept (c).
Evaluation and Visualization: The trained model is evaluated using the calculated cost, and the fit of the regression line is visualized against the data points. The results are plotted using Matplotlib to provide a visual understanding of how well the model captures the data's trends.
